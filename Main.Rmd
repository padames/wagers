## Expected values and variance

I am not a fan of gambling but I find it interesting to think that life itself is a gamble.
To avoid the inevitability of daily random events seems futile: 
traffic volume and weather are but the two more prominent in our daily lives.

Oftentimes forecasts and averages are rendered useless by the
seemingly wild variations encountered in spatial and temporal variations of natural phenomena.
After all statistics in general is well known for failing to predict the unusual events.

## Wagers 

As a means to experiencing the impact of expected values and variability let's follow a slightly modified
example of wagers from [@RodMen2018, p.19].
