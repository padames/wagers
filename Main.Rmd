## Expected values and variance

I am not a fan of gambling but I find interesting to think that life itself is a gamble.
To avoid the inevitability of daily random events seems futile: will I hit heavier traffic
if I leave 5 minutes later than usual? Will our weekend picnic get rained out?

Oftentimes forecasts and averages are rendered useless by the
seeminngly wild variations encountered in spatial and temporal variations of natural phenomena.
After all statistics in general is well known for failing to predict the unusual events.

## Wagers 

As a means to experiencing the impact of expected values and variability
